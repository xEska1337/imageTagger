# Project Description
Image Tagger is a tool that allows you to organize and search your images. You can search images by the text written on them or by AI-generated tags. Additionally, Image Tagger gives you the ability to delete metadata from your images and embed AI tags into the metadata, making your image collection more organized and searchable.

## Features
- **Search images by text**: Search for images based on the text that appears within them.
- **AI-generated tags**: Automatically generate and search images by AI-generated tags.
- **Delete image metadata**: Remove any existing metadata from images.
- **Embed custom tags**: Embed your own tags into the metadata of images for better organization and searchability.
